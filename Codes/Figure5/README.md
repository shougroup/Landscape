Figure 5 compares selection outcome with or without spiking strategy over one cycle. For fair comparison, both selection scheme starts from the same 2 selected Adult communities. These 2 Adults are from Cycle 548 of the simulation plotted in Figure 6A. For each selection scheme, 100 parent Newborns are reproduced from these 2 selected Adults. When the parents mature into Adults, each then gives rise to ~100 offspring Newborns.
* Figure 5A(ii), use the Figure2BC/LandscapePlot.m. For the orange curve, spike_frac = 0; for the teal curve, spike_frac = 0.3.

  ** /Spike: To generate the data, first run repeat_cycle.m, which generates 100 parent communities with the 30%-H spiking strategy. The data for parents communities are stored in /R1. Then run heritability_simu.m, which generates ~100 offspring communities for each parent community with the 30%-H spiking. Figure5C.m plot lower panel of Figure 5C.
  ** /NoSpike: The 100 parent communities come from Cycle 549 of the simulation plotted in Figure 6A. Run heritability_simu.m, which generates ~100 offspring communities for each parent community with no spiking. Figure5C.m plot upper panel of Figure 5C. Figure2D plot Figure 2D.
